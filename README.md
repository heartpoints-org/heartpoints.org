# Mobile Styling Concerns

## HPSearchBar

Autosuggest component wider than viewport on most mobile devices (temporary fix implemented; still need to figure out how to set the `container` of the `Autosuggest` component to a percentage value [currently only accepts vw/vh/px/em])

Suggestion container should be a scrollbar

## LoadedOrganization + LoadVolunteeringOption

Page titles wrap with longer names (text is too big)

This causes the EditButton and DeleteButton for that opp/org to be displayed poorly

## /volunteering/SearchBar + /organizations/SearchBar

Page titles wrap with longer names (text is too big)
