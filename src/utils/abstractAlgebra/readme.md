Abstract Algebra
----------------

This is an exploration into typescript implementation of the basic albstract algebra constructs

- Binary Operator
- Set
- Monoid
- Groups
- Ring
- Field (addition, multiplication, with commutative / distributive props)
- Vectors as having scalars (from a field) and basis vectors (that span the vector space)
- Covectors as functions that take a vector and yield a scalar (they form their own space, the "dual space")
- Tensors
- Modules
