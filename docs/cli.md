## Use the CLI

On a machine with bash shell, use the `./hp` CLI (`./hp` for short) to run various
commands that are useful in the development of heartpoints.org.

To get a list of commands available, just run without arguments: `./hp`

To run without `./`, just make sure that you include `.` in your PATH!
